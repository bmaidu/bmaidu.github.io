      <p>Welcome to my personal webpage!</p>
  
      <p>I am a PhD student at the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Washington under the supervision of <a href="https://www.engr.washington.edu/facresearch/newfaculty/2019/delAlamo">Dr. Juan Carlos del Alamo</a>. Prior to joining del Alamo lab at UW, I obtained my master's degree at the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of California San Diego where I specialized in computational modeling and cardiovascular fluid dynamics.</p>
  
      <p>My PhD research centers on the development of biomedical imageâ€“based, physics-informed deep learning approaches for reconstructing flow fields and stratifying cardiovascular disease risk from incomplete medical imaging data, with a specific focus on stroke risk assessments in the left atrium and left ventricle.</p>
  
      <p>Outside of work, I like hiking, taking road trips, and enjoying nature with families and friends.</p>

## Research Snippet

Left ventricular color-Doppler ultrasound imaging measures 1D flow velocity towards and away from the transducer on a 2D plane, missing complete flow information and pattern. Intraventricular vector flow mapping (VFM) technique has gained traction in the past decade to reconstruct 2D flow maps using color-Doppler images by integrating mass conservation equation. However, traditional VFM techniques do not consider momentum balance (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations) and remain sensitive to imaging artifacts. In our most recent work, we developed AI-VFM leveraging recent advances in physics-informed deep learning to reconstruct super-resolved and complete vector flow and pressure maps.
