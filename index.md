    <p>Welcome to my personal webpage!</p>

    <p>I am a PhD student at the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Washington under the supervision of <a href="https://www.engr.washington.edu/facresearch/newfaculty/2019/delAlamo">Dr. Juan Carlos del Alamo</a>. Prior to joining del Alamo lab at UW, I obtained my master's degree at the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at the University of California San Diego where I specialized in computational modeling and cardiovascular fluid dynamics.</p>

    <p>My PhD research centers on the development of biomedical imageâ€“based, physics-informed deep learning approaches for reconstructing flow fields and stratifying cardiovascular disease risk from incomplete medical imaging data, with a specific focus on stroke risk in the left atrium and left ventricle.</p>
