# Bahetihazi Maidu

Welcome to my personal webpage! 

I am a PhD student at Mechanical Engineering Department in University of Washington under the supervision of [Dr. Juan Carlos del Alamo](https://www.engr.washington.edu/facresearch/newfaculty/2019/delAlamo). Prior to joining del Alamo lab at UW, I obtained my masters degree at Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department in University of California San Diego where I specialized in computational modeling and cardiovascular fluid dynamics.

My PhD research centers on the development of biomedical imageâ€“based, physics-informed deep learning approaches for reconstructing flow fields and stratifying cardiovascular disease risk from incomplete medical imaging data, with a specific focus on stroke risk in the left atrium and left ventricle.

Outside of work, I like hiking, taking road trips, and enjoying nature with families and friends.
